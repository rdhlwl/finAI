# finAI

Fin.AI is a program that takes your .CSV of your card transactions and gives you different representations of that data in easy to read and understand formats. Fin.AI also uses OpenAI's API to analyze the spending in the .CSV and provide financial advice on ways you could save money and potential budgeting strategies that you could follow to maximize the funds in your wallet.

Fin.AI uses a LangChain agent to interface with the LLM and generate the transaction feedback as well as the budgeting tips. For the charts and data I used matplotlib and pandas. For the UI I used streamlit.
